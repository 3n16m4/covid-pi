## Example

### Debug-Build | Time: 23:59:59 | News ticker scrolling here
| Country | Confirmed | Dead    | Recovered |
|---------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| Global  | 4,339,824 | 292,808 | N/A       |
| Germany | 173,273   | 7,754   | N/A       |
| USA     | 1,411,175 | 83,552  | N/A       |

Specification:
-   only support provinces from germany for now
-   have a menu to switch between provinces (prev, next, shows the page number)
-   2 interrupt service routines for buttons (prev, next)
    -   switch between provinces (pages on menu)
    -   update lcd
    
-   while(1) loop:
    -   handle_requests()
        -   request new updates from covid every 20 min (multi interface, async)
            -   read json data when memory chunk is complete and extract the data somewhere (provinces)
            -   display the data on the display once completely fetched (update lcd)
        -   toggle LEDs while fetching data (every 250ms toggle an led and switch to next one)
        -   sleep for 20min (the button isrs (which are just posix threads) can 'interrupt' here and refresh the display i.e. show the next / prev page while the mainthread is sleeping)
